            <h2>Crafting</h2>
            <p>“Some feelings can’t be said out loud.
                So we craft them instead.”
                
                Everyone carries something unseen.
                
                A memory that won’t fade.
                A dream that never got its ending.
                A person who left too soon.
                A version of yourself you’re still trying to become.
                
                Here, crafting is more than just making something.
                It’s about turning silence into shape.
                Grief into color.
                Hope into something you can hold.
                
                Because sometimes, healing doesn’t come in words—
                it comes through your hands.
                
                <p>So welcome to the Crafting Space of Lunar Wish.
                    A place for people who feel deeply.
                    Who remember quietly.
                    Who want to turn their story into something beautiful.
                    
                    No matter who you are, or what you’re carrying—
                    You belong here.
                    Pick your pieces.
                    Make your magic.
                    And craft the parts of your heart that were never meant to be forgotten.</p></p>

                They only grow more beautiful with time.”
                
                There’s something about the past.
                It holds whispers—quiet, soft, but real.
                The scent of an old letter.
                The warmth of a long-lost melody.
                The touch of something worn, but loved.
                
                Vintage isn’t just old.
                It’s a moment captured in time,
                a piece of history,
                an heirloom,
                a story waiting to be retold.
                
                In this corner, we celebrate the forgotten.
                The moments that once felt small—
                but now, are treasured.
                The things that age like fine wine,
                growing richer, deeper,
                with each passing year.
                <p>
                    Welcome to the Perfume Collection of Lunar Wish.
                    Here, every scent tells a story.
                    Every note is a feeling.
                    And every bottle holds the power to bring back
                    what you thought was lost forever.

                There’s a power in scent.
                A way it can take you back—
                to a place you forgot,
                to a feeling you thought was lost.
                
                A perfume is more than just fragrance.
                It’s the trace of a moment.
                The softness of a smile,
                the warmth of a hug,
                the feeling of something you can’t hold but wish you could.
                
                <p>At Lunar Wish, we craft more than just scents.
                    We craft emotions—

                    the ones that remind you of who you are,
                    and who you’ve been.
                    
                    Every bottle carries a story.
                    Every note evokes a memory.
                    A fragrance that becomes part of you—
                    your past, your present,
                    your story, forever carried.

            <p>“Not just a melody,
                but a feeling that lives between us.”
                
                There are moments in life that words can’t quite touch,
                a feeling that can only be expressed through sound.
                A song that speaks to a part of you that’s never been seen,
                a melody that carries your heart with it.
                
                Lunar Serenade isn’t just music.
                It’s a journey through time, space, and emotion.
                A serenade that doesn’t just play,
                but echoes.
                A song that doesn’t just exist,
                but lives.
                It’s a feeling that connects people who have never met,
                a story told with every note,
                every strum, every word.
                
                This is where your heart finds its rhythm.
                Where memories are written in sound.
                Where each note is more than just a note—
                it’s a part of you, a part of everyone,
                a part of something greater.
                
               <P> Welcome to Lunar Serenade.
                Where music isn’t just heard,
                it’s felt.
                Where every song is more than just a melody—
                it’s a connection.
